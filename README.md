In this project I will create a landing page where I am aiming to put in practice the CSS Flex-box knowledge learned from The Odin Project.

In this project I learned to use Flex-box properties such as flex-direction, justify-content, align-items. I learned how to center elements using these properties and to align them using the baseline property for align-items.
